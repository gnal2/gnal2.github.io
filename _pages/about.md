Recently I worked as a Hedge Fund Credit Risk Analyst at [Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking (SGCIB)](https://www.societegenerale.co.uk/en/), I contributed to the monitoring and reporting of the credit risk exposure of a portfolio of hedge funds, using VBA programming and Excel skills. I hold a BSc (Hons) in Actuarial Science from [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/7/actuarial-science), and I am currently pursuing a MSc in Quantitative Finance at [Bayes Business School](https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/quantitative-finance), where I am enhancing my knowledge and skills in financial modeling, research, risk analysis, and data science. I am passionate about learning new things, challenging myself, and delivering high-quality work. I am looking for opportunities to leverage my quantitative finance and risk management skills in a dynamic and innovative environment.

While my professional life revolves around Quantitative Finance, my free time is dedicated to exploring my creative and intellectual passions. Embracing the tranquility of handwork, I find myself drawn to the world of crochet and knitting, where each stitch weaves together a tapestry of creativity and personal expression. The rhythmic repetition of the needles, the soft caress of the yarn against my skin, and the satisfaction of bringing a pattern to life provide a sense of serenity and accomplishment.

My love for the moving image extends beyond the confines of a theater, as I'm an avid movie enthusiast, particularly K-dramas. The power of storytelling, the ability of films to transport us to different worlds, and the emotional resonance that can evoke tears of joy or sorrow make cinema a captivating art form. I'm constantly seeking out new films to explore, from critically acclaimed masterpieces to hidden gems that await discovery.

My thirst for knowledge and constant learning drive me to explore new avenues of learning. Platforms like LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, Udemy, and Quantra provide an unparalleled opportunity to broaden my horizons and delve into diverse fields that pique my curiosity. Whether it's mastering a new programming language, enhancing my writing skills, or exploring the intricacies of ancient civilizations, online courses offer endless possibilities for lifelong learning.

These passions and pursuits extend beyond mere hobbies; they form an integral part of my identity, complementing my professional endeavors and enriching my overall well-being. In the tapestry of my life, these threads of creativity, intellectual curiosity, and personal growth interweave to create a harmonious blend.
