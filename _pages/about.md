Recently I worked as a Hedge Fund Credit Risk Analyst at [Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking (SGCIB)](https://www.societegenerale.co.uk/en/), contributing to the monitoring and reporting of the credit risk exposures of hedge funds, using VBA. 

I hold a BSc (Hons) in Actuarial Science from [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/7/actuarial-science), and I am currently pursuing a MSc in Quantitative Finance at [Bayes Business School](https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/quantitative-finance), where I am enhancing my knowledge and skills in financial modeling, research, risk analysis, and data science.

While my professional life revolves around Quantitative Finance, my free time is dedicated to exploring my creative and intellectual passions. Embracing the tranquility of handwork, I find myself drawn to the world of crochet and knitting, where each stitch weaves together a tapestry of creativity and personal expression. The rhythmic repetition of the needles, the soft caress of the yarn against my skin, and the satisfaction of bringing a pattern to life provide a sense of serenity and accomplishment derived from testing patterns on [yarnspirations](https://www.yarnspirations.com/), [raverly](https://www.ravelry.com/) and instagram.

My thirst for knowledge and constant learning drive me to explore new avenues of learning. Platforms like [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), and [Quantinsti](https://accounts.quantinsti.com/) provide an unparalleled opportunity to broaden my horizons and delve into diverse fields that pique my curiosity. Whether it's mastering a new programming language, enhancing my writing skills, or exploring the intricacies of ancient civilizations, online courses offer endless possibilities for lifelong learning.

These passions and pursuits extend beyond mere hobbies; they form an integral part of my identity, complementing my professional endeavors and enriching my overall well-being. In the tapestry of my life, these threads of creativity, intellectual curiosity, and personal growth interweave to create a harmonious blend.
