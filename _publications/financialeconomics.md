Unveiling Hidden Connections in Stock Markets: A Foundations of Econometrics Coursework Deep Dive
====

In this group coursework for MSc in FM/MTF/QF, we'll embark on a journey to uncover intricate relationships within financial markets. Using OxMetrics9, we'll analyze a rich dataset of four daily stock price indices spanning two decades. Get ready to flex your econometrics muscles as we tackle these exciting challenges:

Data Transformation and Stationarity: We'll carefully prepare the data, transforming it into quarterly averages and logarithmic form, before assessing its stationarity using unit root tests.
Model Specification and Selection: We'll explore a range of autoregressive distributed lags (ADL) models to capture the relationship between EURO STOXX 50 and NIKKEI 225, meticulously selecting the best fit based on misspecification tests.
Cointegration vs Spurious Regression: We'll dive into the delicate dance between cointegration and spurious correlation, investigating whether CAC40 and NIKKEI 225 truly cointegrate or merely exhibit superficial connections.
Granger Causality: We'll unravel the potential causal influence of NIKKEI 225 on other stock prices, shedding light on predictive dynamics within the markets.
ARCH and GARCH Modeling: We'll delve into volatility modeling using ARCH and GARCH techniques, accounting for time-varying conditional variances and enhancing risk management strategies
